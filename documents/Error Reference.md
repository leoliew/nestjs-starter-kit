# Response Reference

## HTTP Status Codes

| Status Code | Meaning |
|-------------| ------- |
| 400         | Bad Request -- Your request is invalid. Double-check your JSON-RPC body. |
| 401         | Unauthorized -- You must authenticate your request with an API key. |
| 403         | Forbidden -- You've hit your **capacity limit**, or your request was rejected by your app's **whitelist settings.** |
| 429         | Too Many Requests -- You've exceeded your concurrent requests capacity or [Compute Units](https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/compute-units) per second capacity. Check out the [Throughput](https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/throughput) page for solutions. |
| 500         | Internal Server Error -- We're unable to process your request right now. Get in touch with us if you see this. |


### 

Example Response

    // Example 429 Error
    {
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "error": {
            "code": 429,
            "message": "Your app has exceeded its compute units per second capacity. If you have retries enabled, you can safely ignore this message. If not, check out https://docs.alchemyapi.com/guides/rate-limits"
        },
        "id": 1
    }
    

For JSON-RPC specific errors, Alchemy returns a `200` with the JSON-RPC error in the JSON response.

JSON-RPC Error Codes

Code

Possible Return Message

Description

429

Your app has exceeded its compute unit per second capacity.

Check out the [Throughput](https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/throughput) page for solutions.

\-32000

Server error

Reserved for implementation-defined server-errors. See hint below.

\-32001 to -32099

Parity errors

These errors are parity specific and thus relevant for when using the Kovan network, see the parity sectionbelow.

\-32600

Invalid Request

The JSON sent is not a valid Request object.

\-32601

Method not found

The method does not exist / is not available.

\-32602

Invalid parameter

Invalid method parameter(s).

\-32603

Internal error

\-32700

Parse error

> ### ðŸ“˜
> 
> **NOTE:**
> 
> \-32000 is used for many server errors. Here are a few common examples:
> 
> `"already known"`
> 
> *   This generally means the transaction already posted and is on the node in a pending state. Sometimes this error occurs when transactions fail at first but are retried when the node already knows of them
> 
> `"Unspecified origin not on whitelist"`
> 
> *   This error means whoever is making the request is not on the whitelist for using your API key.
> 
> `"filter not found"`
> 
> *   Filters expire after 5 minutes of inactivity so if it's not found the filter likely expired.
> 
> `"Request timed out. Client should retry."`
> 
> *   Gateway timeouts (usually from nodes). Clients should retry the request.
> 
> "`transaction underpriced`"
> 
> *   Transaction was sent with too low gas. Re-send the transaction with higher gas!

> Custom Error Fields are defined at the contract level. Therefore, the types within the error field might vary by contract. Read more about this [here](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/04/21/custom-errors/).
